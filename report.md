# Budget Breakdown
To estimate the costs for a 3-day trip to Dhaka from 1st March to 3rd March, we'll consider the categories of accommodation, food, transport, and activities. Since specific prices are not provided in the context, we will use general assumptions based on typical travel costs in Dhaka and calculate subtotals using a calculator logic approach.

### Assumptions:
- Accommodation: The average cost of a hotel in Dhaka can range from BDT 2,000 to BDT 5,000 per night for a mid-range hotel. For a 3-day stay, the estimated cost range would be BDT 6,000 to BDT 15,000.
- Food: Eating out in Dhaka can cost between BDT 200 to BDT 500 per meal. Assuming three meals a day, the daily food cost could range from BDT 600 to BDT 1,500. For 3 days, this would be BDT 1,800 to BDT 4,500.
- Transport: Local transport costs can vary, but on average, a daily pass or ride-hailing services might cost around BDT 500 to BDT 1,000 per day. For 3 days, this estimates to BDT 1,500 to BDT 3,000.
- Activities: The cost of tours and entry fees can significantly vary. Assuming an average cost of BDT 1,500 to BDT 3,000 per person for a day tour, for 3 days of activities, the cost could range from BDT 4,500 to BDT 9,000.

### Estimated Costs:
| Category | Assumptions | Estimated Cost Range | Subtotal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accommodation | Mid-range hotel, BDT 2,000 - BDT 5,000 per night | BDT 6,000 - BDT 15,000 | BDT 10,500 |
| Food | BDT 200 - BDT 500 per meal, 3 meals/day | BDT 1,800 - BDT 4,500 | BDT 3,150 |
| Transport | BDT 500 - BDT 1,000 per day | BDT 1,500 - BDT 3,000 | BDT 2,250 |
| Activities | BDT 1,500 - BDT 3,000 per day for tours | BDT 4,500 - BDT 9,000 | BDT 6,750 |

### Total Estimated Cost and Status Against Budget:
The total estimated cost for the trip is BDT 10,500 (Accommodation) + BDT 3,150 (Food) + BDT 2,250 (Transport) + BDT 6,750 (Activities) = BDT 22,650.

Given the estimated total cost of BDT 22,650, the trip exceeds the budget of BDT 20,000.
