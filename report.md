# Budget Breakdown
To estimate the costs for a trip to India from 2026-04-10 to 2026-04-15, we will consider various components such as accommodation, food, transport, and activities. Since specific prices are not provided, we will rely on general research and calculator logic to compute subtotals and a grand total.

### Assumptions and Estimated Costs
Given the lack of specific data, we will make assumptions based on average costs for each category, acknowledging that actual prices may vary.

| Category | Assumptions | Estimated Cost Range | Subtotal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accommodation | Average hotel price in India for 5 nights | BDT 8,000 - BDT 15,000 | BDT 11,500 |
| Food | Average meal price in India for 5 days | BDT 2,000 - BDT 5,000 | BDT 3,500 |
| Transport | Domestic travel and local transport for 5 days | BDT 3,000 - BDT 6,000 | BDT 4,500 |
| Activities | Average cost of visiting national parks, urban exploration, and other activities for 5 days | BDT 4,000 - BDT 8,000 | BDT 6,000 |

### Total Estimated Cost and Status Against Budget
Total Estimated Cost: BDT 11,500 + BDT 3,500 + BDT 4,500 + BDT 6,000 = BDT 25,500

Status Against Budget BDT 30,000: The estimated total cost of BDT 25,500 is below the budget of BDT 30,000, indicating that the trip can be undertaken within the allotted budget. However, it's crucial to note that these estimates are based on assumptions and may vary based on actual costs encountered during the trip.
